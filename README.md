## Markov chain
Generate fantasy names using dictionaries of words as training data. 

It uses Markov chain, a procedural algorithm, to make coherent chains of values. 

The results are highly customizable. The **Markov's order** defines the amount of characters "looked back" by the algorithm. Set lower orders to generate more random results. 

You can create your own set of data to generate any kind of names including food, animals, places, monsters, etc. 
Your saved lists will be stored locally on your device. 

It has been inspired by [Tw1ddle](https://github.com/Tw1ddle)'s [MarkovNameGenerator](https://github.com/Tw1ddle/MarkovNameGenerator)

## Generic Fantasy
Generate random names that can be used for any generic characters (heroes, villains, main protagonist, etc.) in most fantasy campaigns.

These fantasy names use a list of thousands of names, generating millions of possible results.


## Fantastic Species
Generate names for a specific fantasy race. 

Some species are gendered (male and female). You may also find two alternatives for the same species. It could be useful to distinguishing two different kind of population/tribes (e. g. Wood and High elves).

| Species  | Gender | Alternative
| :---         |     :---:      |     :---:      |
| Goblins | NO | NO |
| Orcs | NO | NO |
| Ogres | NO | NO |
| Dwarfs | YES | NO |
| Halflings | YES | NO |
| Gnomes | YES | NO |
| Elves | YES | YES |
| Cavemen | YES | NO |
| Faerykind | YES | YES |
| Dark Elves | YES | YES |
| Half-Demons | YES | NO |
| Dragons | YES | NO |
| Demons | NO | NO |
| Angels | YES | NO |

    <noun> & <noun>
